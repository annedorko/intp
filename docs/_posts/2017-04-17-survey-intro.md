Howdy, there! Welcome to the analysis series for the **INTP General Survey 2017**. This is the first in a string of posts which will evaluate the latest results submitted.

If you know your MBTI Personality type, you can contribute to the dataset by [completing the survey](https://anne274.typeform.com/to/ycfkp1). Though there are many personal questions asked, data is kept anonymous! I’ll attempt to keep these blog posts updated with the latest data available.

Important Notes on the Survey
-----------------------------

<p class="lead">
<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This survey cannot be considered scientific or actually representative of all INTPs due to respondents being a convenience sample.
</p>
That said, any kind of data is fun and until the day we can perform a scientific survey, this is good practice to look for any trends or other interesting information that pops up. I have done my best to clean survey results of spam, duplicate answers, and generally unhelpful or irrelevant input before crunching the results.

Knowing this, let's take a look at the respondents to get perspective on what further analysis might indicate.

-   91.8% of survey takers are INTPs
-   63.4% of survey takers are women

These are important things to know before we take the following data and try to make generalizations!

As we are working with a convenience sample, we can’t make assumptions. For example: we can’t say that INTPs are mostly women even though they represent that largest number of respondents. We would need a truly random sampling of INTPs to determine the likelihood of an INTP being male or female.

About the Data Sample
---------------------

Our data sample comes from followers of the [Being an INTP Facebook](https://facebook.com/INTP.info) page and the [INTP.info Twitter account](https://twitter.com/intpinfo), which represent about 6k+ MBTI enthusiasts all together. So far, we have had 134 legitimate respondents.

Below, you can see the complete breakdown of respondents and gender.

The majority of test takers were assigned their MBTI type through an online test or assigned it to themselves after reading through all 16 profiles. This means that our sample may or may not be 'true' INTPs (if such a thing exists). However, as this is only in good fun, for the sake of this study we will assume that the MBTI personality types are accurate.

Conclusion
----------

With these initial disclaimers out of the way, I can move forward in publishing the results of this survey.

I'll use authoritative language as if this were a scientifically accurate survey, but you should take it with a grain of salt. Stay posted for future installments! We’ll be digging into parents of INTPs, romance and relationships, and much more.
