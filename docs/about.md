My name is [Anne Dorko](https://www.annedorko.com/), and I am an INTP.

This site was originally launched under the url _INTP.info_, but the domain expired long ago. I now run INTP-related projects here on GitHub pages, where everything is held onto for safekeeping even if I don’t update for a while. Which, you know, is inevitable because projects are fleeting.

In the meantime, there is a [Facebook page](https://facebook.com/INTP.info) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/intpinfo).

There you will find discussion, musings, humor, and data surrounding the life of an INTP. For more permanent and long-winded observations, feel free to poke around here on this site.

Meanwhile, help us learn more about INTPs by taking the [INTP General Survey 2017](https://anne274.typeform.com/to/ycfkp1). I’m using the R programming language to explore the results and share them with you here and on the Facebook and Twitter pages. You can use the partially-cleaned data for your own analysis on [GitHub here](https://github.com/annedorko/intp/).
