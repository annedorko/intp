This cured 6 years of depression instantly when I learned to do it, so well that I spent 2 or 3 years nolonger able to feel sadness at all (even things that previously had made me sad).  Until my grandpa died (almost felt no emotion, felt terrible about not being able to feel bad, then it finally broke through all at once), then it sorta un-repressed partially.  Half a year later, it was still stuck at a point where I could only feel sad 2 seconds (consistently) until the feeling vanished instantly/unnaturally, only I wasn't doing it and couldn't stop it.  One last (strong-ish; personal) sad event managed to make me feel sad longer than 2 seconds, and it seems to be back at a satisfactory level now.  I'm really scared to ever try hiding being sad now because it's really not good to not feel sad.  It's an amplifier, can help you feel happier, and honestly feels good in my opinion when not out of control.  I'm trying to learn how to do the meditation thing I did a while ago which I strongly believe is how&when I learned to just cast it out.  I want to dangle off a cliff to make fear noticeable enough to focus on, meditate (need to get good at it beforehand) and cast that feeling out, theoretically repressing it (and curing my fear based anxiety disorder instantly).  Only similar stuff I find to what I did is on sites called things like ""themystic.org"", I believe the strong irrational sad feeling of depression is what made me able to focus on it, detatch, and cast it out.  I was trying to view my thoughts and emotions without emotion/irrational bias, didn't think much of it when I did it, but did notice it was unusual, like an 'aerial view of thoughts and emotions' apart from both of them.  Nolonger needing to 'meditate' after knowing how it feels to 'push' it out.  Fear might get tossed out in a whole different way, and heights (a 200 foot freefall) are the only thing I can think of that have ever created intense fear despite knowing it's going to be okay, might skydive instead, but don't want to zone out.  Sorry lol, a bit unnecessary, but interesting.","Talking in person.  I am unable to think like I normally do when around people, and in an undescribable way, am unable to speak without great difficulty despite not mentally thinking irrationally or anxiously.  The interesting thing is, there is one person (significant other) that it has no effect on, and WOW is it different just being able to speak endlessly without even thinking or putting effor in.  I used to think I just lacked social skills/experience, but that's obviously not the case if I can talk to her so well.  Only met her 4 years ago.",4,6,5,"Gym.  I didn't pay attention or try for grades because I knew how unimportant high school grades are, and was a little lazy so why do the unnecessary?  Still paid attention when I saw useful stuff, and looked things up when I didn't understand, but never in time for tests, often learned from tests.  Took AP Physics, passed, but they changed the requirements because of me xD  It was interesting enough to get grades, but too much work all at once in my opinion so I'd just listen to my ipod 1/4 of the semester.","AP-Physics, Chemistry (I'd look up the chemistry of explosives while the teacher was rambling about her stuff tho), Electronics in college (top student cuz I knew it already), psycology, law (wanted to be a lawyer until I saw how much of a waste of life it is), video productions (made dank videos), construction1&2 (half for the class, half for the intense group mischief), woodshop 1&2 (made a gravity powered kinetic sculpture, from plans tho.  loved woodworking), small engines.  ALSO!  ART!  The most important thing in the world, forced me to put the required time into art, to realise I can art.","Math.  The only thing that grades mattered in because if I had the grades in middle school to skip the dumb kid math class, and if I got the grades to pass algebra2 the first time, I'd have taken pre-calculus or calculus.  A lot of what I do now basically requires it, even a random cryptography class I took said 'basic math' is a requirement, and they meant calculus becaue I was looking things up every step of the way that they assumed I knew.","Cooking, Anatomy & Physiology (wanted, but heard how much homework it was), Music Theory","None","Self","",4,1,"2017-04-05 01:11:51","2017-04-05 03:02:03","b2b519323b","Primary Sexuality","6"
