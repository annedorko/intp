# Being an INTP

In 2009, I [started up](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20091201000000*/intp.info) a website for INTPs, but promptly let the domain expire.

However, the [Facebook](https://facebook.com/INTP.info) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intpinfo) page lived on! Now, I'm putting any future work related to these communities on GitHub, where it can live on forever regardless of how often I come back to keep things updated.

As with everything an INTP does... this is a work in progress that may not ever be completed.
